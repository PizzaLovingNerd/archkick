# Archkick - The easiest way to install and setup arch!
ArchKick refers to the fact that it kicks off arch in seconds. It is an easy install script for arch linux that can be installed and run in one command! It asks what desktop environment you want, does the dirty work for you, and much more. It even lets users know what a setting does that is optional to get them on their feet. The idea is the make it as easy as pie, so that installing arch is really easy!
